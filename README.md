### Machine learning scoring

- Give 1 point for exploring some area that hasn't been explored in 1 min or something like that, diminishing returns
for places that have already been explored. So if you explore the same place, then wait 10 seconds, you get like 15% of
the reward. If you explore it immediately after you get a -1??
- 



- Mark "explored" areas in green and slowly turn back to black again
- Show sensor radius around drones




### Todo:
- [ ] Draw a map with drones; show x, y, z
- Add multiple kinds of drones
    - [ ] Speedy
    - [ ] Weak
    - [ ] Strong
    - [ ] Slow
- Scenarios like:
    - [ ] Drifting in water
    - [ ] Stuck on a steep cliff
    - [ ] Multiple drones losing sensors
    - [ ] Multiple drones being destroyed in an area (hopefully they learn to avoid that area? fires?)
    - [ ] Saving multiple people
